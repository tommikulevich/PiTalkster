### 🍿 Disclaimer

> _Before I started this project, I decided to write a short disclaimer to present some context of its creation. I wanted to create my own mini-product, starting with the definition of "customer" requirements (that is, de facto mine) until the implementation of a prototype that meets these requirements. Since now there is hype on LLM (especially curious about models that can even be run on Raspberry Pi), I came up with the idea of making a mini communicator/chat on the RPi, with the ability to enter voice prompts, and receiving the result on mini-display or using audio. I would like to go through the architecture design stage, and write the main app mostly in C (due to the potential interaction with HW, e.g. LCD and microphone), preferably also using TDD. Time will tell if this works out!_
